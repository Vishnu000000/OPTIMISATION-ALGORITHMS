# OPTIMISATION ALGORITHMS CODES

This repository contains various implementations of optimisation algorithms in Jupyter Notebooks. The codes serve as examples and references for understanding and applying different optimisation strategies in computational problems. You can run these notebooks locally or directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## 📌 Overview

The project includes implementations of the following optimisation algorithms:
- **ABC (Artificial Bee Colony)**
- **ALO (Ant Lion Optimizer)**
- **CSA (Cuckoo Search Algorithm)**
- **DragonFly Algorithm**
- **GA (Genetic Algorithm)**
- **GWO (Grey Wolf Optimizer)**
- **MothFlame Optimization**
- **PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)**
- **SA (Simulated Annealing)**
- **SOPT (Self-Optimising / Self-Organising Particle Tracker)**
- **TLBO (Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization)**

Each notebook demonstrates the algorithm's logic, application, and performance on sample optimisation problems.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run the notebooks locally, ensure you have the following:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (preferably 3.6 or higher) or Google colab
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/)
- Required libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)  
  Install them via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
For running the notebooks in Google Colab, simply upload the notebook or open them directly from GitHub using Colab’s GitHub integration.

🚀 Getting Started

For Running in Google Colab
1. Open Google Colab.
2. Click on File > Open notebook > GitHub.
3. Enter the repository URL:
https://github.com/Vishnu000000/OPTIMISATION-ALGORITHMS-CODES
4. Select the notebook you wish to run.
Colab will load the notebook, and you can start executing the cells directly in your browser.
