# Interactive Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithm Visualizer | BTech Project

This project is an interactive web application that provides a platform for comparing and visualizing the performance of various nature-inspired optimization algorithms. Developed using Streamlit, it serves as both a tool for understanding complex optimization concepts and a portfolio piece demonstrating proficiency in algorithm implementation, data visualization, and web application development.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

* **10 Implemented Algorithms:** The application includes a modular framework with implementations of a diverse set of optimization algorithms:

  * Genetic Algorithm (GA)

  * Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

  * Simulated Annealing (SA)

  * Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO)

  * Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)

  * Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA)

  * Antlion Optimization (ALO)

  * Dragonfly Algorithm (DA)

  * Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO)

  * Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)

* **Interactive Visualization:** Users can select an algorithm and objective function, and the application generates a real-time 3D plot showing the algorithm's search path on the function's landscape. This dynamic visualization helps to intuitively understand the exploration and exploitation trade-offs of each method.

* **Customizable Parameters:** The sidebar allows for easy adjustment of key algorithm parameters (e.g., population size, number of iterations, mutation rate), enabling users to experiment and observe how these changes impact performance.

* **Clear Results:** The application displays the best solution found and its corresponding fitness value, providing a quantitative measure of each algorithm's effectiveness.
